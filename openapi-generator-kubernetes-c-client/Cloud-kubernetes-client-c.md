# client-c : C client library for kubernetes

## Background

API Server is the core componenet of Kubernetes. It provides RESTful API for client to operate kubernetes' build-in or customer resource definition (CRD) resouces such as Pod, Service, ConfigMap, etc...

User can program to use these RESTful API by http library. And Kubernetes community and some developers have developed many libraries to wrap these API for users to use in their programs. e.g. [Python library](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/), [Java library](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/).

client-c is the client library implementation written by the C programming language. It is generated by OpenAPI [generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) and kubernetes client [gen](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/gen) based on Kubernetes RESTful API [spec](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json). It can be used by C and C plus plus program easily. 

## Source code
